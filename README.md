# Powerline-Fault-Detection

Using a LSTM deep learning model to detect damage in powerlines based on partial discharge patterns that appear in a high-frequency signal time series.

THe project is for a Kaggle competition, VSB Fault Detection. Detailed information can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/vsb-power-line-fault-detection
